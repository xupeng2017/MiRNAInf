# MiRNAInf
## Introduction
* MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of important noncoding RNAs, which play important roles in tumorigenesis and development by targeting oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes (TSGs). One miRNA can regulate multiple genes, and one gene can be regulated by multiple miRNAs. In this study, we propose a miRNA influence capturing (MiRNAInf) to decipher regulation relations of miRNAs on target genes and identify critical miRNAs in cancers in a systematic approach.
